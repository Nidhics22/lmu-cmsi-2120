\section*{1}
    \item Write $P(\{a, b, c\})$ in a form in which all elements are listed.
        \begin{shaded} 
        P(S) =  \{\{\}, \{a\}, \{b\}, \{c\}, \{a, b\}, \{a, c\}, \{b, c\}, \{a, b, c\} \}
        \end{shaded}        



\section*{2}
    \item How many partitions are there of $\{x \in \mathbb{N} | 1 \leq x \wedge x \geq 10\}$?
        \begin{shaded} 
        115975
        \end{shaded}     





\section*{3}
    \item Let A be a set and m and n be positive integers. Would you say that $A^{m + n} = A^{m} * A^{n}$? Give arguments for or against accepting this equality as fact. (Hint: you may want to consider the sets $A * A^{2}$ and $A^{2} * A$)
        \begin{shaded} 
        Yes,  if we have the same base but different powers then $A^{m + n} = A^{m} * A^{n}$ would satisfy (e.g. $a^{12} = a^{5} + a^{7$ where which is equal to $a^{5} * a^ {7} = a^{5+7} = a^{12}$).
        \end{shaded}     





\section*{4}
\item Express, in lambda notation, the function which when passed two functions f and g, returns the composition of f and g. (Don't use the predefined Â· symbol for composition. Actually define the meaning of composition in your answer.)
        \begin{shaded} 
        \lambda x : f(g(x))
        \end{shaded}     


\section*{5}
    \item Let $f = \lambda x. 4x - 3x^{2}$?
    \\a. What is $f^{0}(0.01)$?
    \\$f^{0}(0.01) = 0.01$
    \\b. What is $f^{1}(0.01)$?
    \\$f^{1}(0.01) = 0.0397$
    \\c. What is $f^{2}(0.01)$?
    \\ $f^{2}(0.01) = 0.154$
    \\d. What is $f^{5}(0.01)$?
    \\$f^{5}(0.01) = 0.1713$
    \\e. What is $f^{30}(0.01)$?
    \\$f^{30}(0.01) = 1.286553251$
    \\f. What is $f^{50}(0.01)$ according to Java?
    \\ $f^{50}(0.01) = 1.3056006785398018$ according to Java
    \\g. What is $f^{50}(0.01)$ according to your handheld calculator?
    \\ $f^{50}(0.01) = 1.063193699$ according to the calculator
    \\h. Explain why we can never write out the exact value, as a decimal number, of $f^{75}(0.01)$ in 10 point Times New Roman on printer paper that is produced on Earth.
    \\There are too many digits after the decimal for us to get an exact value for $f^{75}(0.01)$. It's an irrational number that we cannot write to exact precision.
    \\i. Do you think it will be possible in our lifetime whether we will even know the first digit of the decimal expansion of $f^{100}(0.01)$? Why or why not?     
    \\ Yes. The uncertainty with rational numbers is in the latter decimal digits. So we should be able to determine the value of the first digit after the decimal.

    \item What is the time complexity of this code fragment? (Use $\theta$-notation)

\section*{7}
    \item What is the time complexity of this code fragment? (Use $\theta$-notation)

\section*{19}
    We have seen that there is little hope of solving problems of size 100 or so with algorithm complexity $\lambda n. 2^{n}$ even when billions of operations can be carried out per seconds. But what about algorithms of complexity $\lambda n. 1.1^{n}$? How do these algorithms compete with quadratic algorithms? In particular, if a billion operations can be performed in one second, up to what problem size will the $\lambda n. 1.1^{n}$ be faster than a $\lambda n. 2^{n}$ algorithm?
        \begin{shaded} 
    $\lambda n. 1.1^{n}$ increases in run-time significantly slower than $\lambda n. 2^{n}$ for input ranges from 0 to 50 ($\{n | 0 \leq n \leq 50\}$). After that, $\lambda n. 1.1^{n}$ grows sharply and intersects with $\lambda n. n^{2}$ at in input of 96 (95.717). $\lambda n. 1.1^{n}$ results in many more operations for subsequent input sizes (eg. For an input size of 200 (n=200), $\lambda n. n^{2}$ takes 40,000 operations while $\lambda n. 1.1^{n}$ will take 189,905,277 operations).
        \end{shaded}
